[Significa](https://significa.pt/) is an Oporto based design studio founded in late 2013. Despite being specialised in Interaction Design and Brand Development, we believe that good design thinking can answer almost any question and solve most problems. We aim to provide meaningful design solutions to achieve the best user engagement possible in any situation.

## About the challenge

It’s a pretty simple teste, which you should to write a app in React and using the provided screens as reference. You’ll need to request a API to get a JSON feed, filter the data and print it on view.

Use can use whatever boilerplate and approach you want, we just wouldn’t like to see a complex application but we encourage you use your favorites tools and ways to build a React application.

### The app is website about movies with two screens:

* **Home page:** with a search field and a list with the results;

  _Think about the empty state, loading state and movie no found_

* **Movie screen:** the details about a movie selected;

  _Think about loading state and page not found_

The purpose of this challenge is to rate your skills about (HTML, CSS, Javascript and React Api) and approach to composing a simple web app given a set of screens and an API feed. We will also assess the generated HTML, CSS, and JS output.

### Two importante points:

1.  We didn’t create the screen of mobile version, so don’t forget to build a responsive app, we would like to see your design skills as well.
2.  On the screens there is a button like, it would be great if this information persisted
